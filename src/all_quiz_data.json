      "deepExplanation": "Through the process of photosynthesis, where plants use sunlight to make their food, they also release a gas called oxygen into the air. Oxygen is absolutely vital for most living things on Earth, including humans and animals, as it is necessary for respiration, the process that provides energy to our bodies. Plants are therefore crucial for maintaining the quality of the air we breathe."
